##Electronic Currencies for Latin America
Although  cryptocurrencies of many types already exist, there is fairly a low adoption in Latin American countries. 
Among the reasons, is that no popular representation of a stablecoin has been created for the currencies in Latin America. 
In this project I will like to create a simple MVP of a stablecoin system to create electronic versions of currencies in a permisionless way.

##Price Oracle of Latin American currencies
One of the barriers for a digital cryptocurrency that can represet a Latin American currency is the lack of price oracle for these currencies.
